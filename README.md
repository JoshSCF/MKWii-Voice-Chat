# MKWii-Voice-Chat
**This bot was designed to function in one server. If you intend to use it, you will need to modify the source code.**

This was a small project from 2018 that I hosted on a Discord server. Due to the current lack of use, I have decided to stop hosting the bot and make the source public.

The bot works by scraping player information from the Wiimmfi website, checking for any registered users that are in the "Searching" voice channel in the server, and then moving them into the voice channel dedicated to their room. This then allows the user to chat with anyone else they're racing with via Discord.

The source wasn't intended to be released, which is why it isn't organised very well.
